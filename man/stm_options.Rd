\usage{
stm_options(
  enabled = TRUE,
  order_bound = 10L,
  shortest_deterministic = TRUE,
  exclusion = TRUE,
  update_exclusion = TRUE,
  escape = "ax"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{enabled}{(Logical scalar)
Whether or not the model is enabled.}

\item{order_bound}{(Integerish scalar)
The model's Markov order bound. For example, an order bound of two means
that the model makes predictions based on the two preceding symbols.}

\item{shortest_deterministic}{(Logical scalar)
If TRUE, the model will 'select' the shortest available order
that provides a deterministic prediction, if such an order exists,
otherwise defaulting to the longest available order.
For a given prediction, if this rule results in a lower model order
than would have otherwise been selected, 
then full counts (not update-excluded counts) will be used for 
the highest model order (but not for lower model orders).
This behaviour matches the implementations of PPM* in 
Pearce (2005) and
Bunton (1996).}

\item{exclusion}{(Logical scalar)
If TRUE, implements exclusion as defined in 
Pearce (2005) and
Bunton (1996).}

\item{update_exclusion}{(Logical scalar)
If TRUE, implements update exclusion as defined in 
Pearce (2005) and
Bunton (1996).}

\item{escape}{(Character scalar)
Takes values 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', or 'ax',
corresponding to the eponymous escape methods 
in Pearce (2005).
Note that there is a mistake in the definition of escape method 
"AX" in Pearce (2005); 
the denominator of lambda needs to have 1 added.
This is what we implement here. Note that Pearce's
LISP implementation correctly adds 1 here, like us.}

\description{
Creates an option list for the short-term discrete viewpoint
models in the viewpoint regression model.
Most (all?) of these options are passed to the PPM model.
